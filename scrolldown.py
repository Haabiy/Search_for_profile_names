# Scrolldown scrolls by clicking next until the specified page
# Goes through Resized_data lists
# In fact, instead of a user entering interval of pages, we could click until the button is disabled
# and Python knows that is the dead-end of the list.
# However, don't forget also LinkedIn search results are based on "Relevance" where you don't need to go until the end
# of a page of one search result. Technically it's possible but I have not used that methodology in this code but I have
# commented just the logic in case you'd like to do it that way.
